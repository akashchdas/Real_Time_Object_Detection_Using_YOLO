# Real_Time_Object_Detection_Using_YOLO
  The project uses device cam to perform real time object detection using YOLOv3, written using DarkNet architecture. 

## Acknowledgement : 
  > The project was made to get a deeper understanding of YOLO and CNN as a part of **Fastrack To ML** course by [Coding Club IITG](https://codingiitg.github.io/index.html)
  > I have been strongly inspired and guided by [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-v3-object-detection-with-keras-461d2cfccef6) article.

## DataSet :
  > Download the YOLOv3 pre-trained dataset from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-v3-object-detection-with-keras-461d2cfccef6).
  > Place weights in **model** folder under the name "yolov3.weights" for training purpose.
  
## Model :

## Running the project:
  > Run *Make_Model.py* to save the model trained by using downloaded weights 
  > Run *Real_Time_Detection.py* to perform real time detection of objects using YOLOv3
